# MNIST Dataset for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

This repository contains code for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a popular benchmark dataset consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits.

## Dataset Description

The MNIST dataset contains grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. Each image is 28x28 pixels in size. The dataset is divided into two parts: training set (60,000 images) and test set (10,000 images). The goal is to train a CNN model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the test set.

## Requirements

- Python (>=3.6)
- TensorFlow (>=2.0) or PyTorch (>=1.0)
- NumPy (>=1.16)
- Matplotlib (>=3.0)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Mnist-CNN-Model.git
cd mnist-cnn
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Model Architecture

The CNN model architecture used in this project consists of multiple convolutional layers, followed by pooling layers and fully connected layers. The exact architecture and hyperparameters can be found in the code files.

## Results

After training the model on the MNIST dataset, the following results were achieved:

- Training accuracy: 99.66%
- Test accuracy: 99.25%
